# Spellslinger

An ugly Rails app with no styling that allows you to create a deck, upload a csv with cards associated to that deck, and then view stats on said deck.

I have added no styling to this whatsoever, because CSS is hard and not my thing.

* Ruby version 2.5.1

## How to run this program
